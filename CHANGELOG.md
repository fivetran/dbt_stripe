## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨

  - Prefixed the following fields based on their corresponding upstream source to maintain clarity:

| **Previous Name**                          | **New Name**                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| available_on | balance_transaction_available_on
| currency | balance_transaction_currency
| amount | balance_transaction_amount
| fee | balance_transaction_fee
| net | balance_transaction_net
| type | balance_transaction_type
| source | balance_transaction_source_id
| reporting_category | balance_transaction_reporting_category
| description | balance_transaction_description

## Updates:
- Introduced the following new models, named after the Stripe reports that they follow. These models help reproduce reports available in the [Stripe Reporting API](https://stripe.com/docs/reports/report-types). The reports introduced in this update include:
  - stripe__activity_itemized_2
  - stripe__balance_change_from_activity_itemized_3
  - stripe__ending_balance_reconciliation_itemized_4
  - stripe__payout_itemized_3

- Updated the [`stripe__balance_transactions`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/blob/main/models/stripe__balance_transactions.sql) with the following changes:
  - `reporting_category` has been updated to pull directly from the titular column. If no `reporting_category` exists, it then falls to sort based on balance transaction  `type` in accordance to the Stripe [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/reports/reporting-categories).
  - Added the following fields:
    - dispute fields
    - transfer fields
    - additional payout fields
    - additional customer fields
    - additional card fields
    - additional charge fields
    - additional invoice fields
  - Updated `customer_facing_amount` to include for refunds and disputes as well
  - Updated `charge_id` to charge, refund, then dispute objects consecutively



## Under the Hood:

- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job.
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github).

# dbt_stripe v0.10.1
[PR #61](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/pull/61) contains the following changes:
## Documentation Updates
- Updated the Metadata pivot documentation to be more clear that these variables only affect the `dbt_stripe_source` staging models.
- Added reference to the new `stripe__card_metadata` and `stripe__invoice_line_item_metadata` metadata variables that are available in the latest source package update.

## Under the Hood
- Updated the `card` and `invoice_line_item` seed files to be consistent with the source package versions. Specifically to include the metadata fields.
- Added a new BuildKite run statement to test a few of the metadata variables.

## Upstream Changes
- See the source package [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for updates made to the staging layer in dbt_stripe_source `v0.9.1`.

# dbt_stripe v0.10.0
[#60](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/pull/60) includes the following changes:
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨:
- Unwrapped `total_*` fields from the for loop in `stripe__daily_overview` to reduce compute required for previous for-loops 
- Add `account_id` in `int_stripe__account_rolling_totals` for use as part of the join in the case where more than 1 `account_id` exists.

## Under the Hood
- Intermediate model materializations have changed from ephemeral to table to reduce the compute required for the complexity of calculations. 

# dbt_stripe v0.9.0

[#56](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/pull/56) includes the following changes:
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨:
- `stripe__subscription_line_items` has been removed. To recreate it, simply filter `stripe__invoice_line_items` for where `subscription_id` is not null.
- The `stripe__weekly_overview`, `stripe__quarterly_overview`, and `stripe__monthly_overview` models have been removed as they can be recreated directly from the `stripe__daily_overview` by rolling up the date grain.
- The `stripe__invoice_line_item` and `stripe__subscription_line_items` have been renamed to `stripe__invoice_line_item_details` and `stripe__subscription_details`.
- Following the addition of the new `pricing` source table which may replace the `plan` table depending on whether you migrated to the Price API ([Stripe doc here.](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/migrating-prices)), the following columns in `stripe__invoice_line_items` have been updated. This package will draw the respective columns from the `price` object by default if it exists. However, if you still have and wish to keep using `plan`, you can set `stripe__using_price` to False. For more please see the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe#leveraging-plan-vs-price-sources)

| **Previous Name**                          | **New Name**                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| plan_amount    | price_plan_amount
| plan_interval    | price_plan_interval
| plan_interval_count    | price_plan_interval_count
| plan_nickname    | price_plan_nickname
| plan_product_id    | price_plan_product_id                                                                                                       |

- In addition, `stripe__plan_metadata` variable has been renamed to `stripe__price_plan_metadata`

- Stripe connectors set up after February 09, 2022 will use the subscription_history table, as they will no longer be syncing the subscription table. This package uses `subscription_history` by default if it exists. However, if you still have the `subscription` table and wish to use it instead, then set the `stripe__using_subscription_history` to False.

- Variables have been prefixed with `stripe__` so they can be used globally.

| **Previous Name**                          | **New Name**                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| using_subscriptions | stripe__using_subscriptions
| using_subscription_history | stripe__using_subscription_history
| using_price | stripe__using_price

- In the `stripe__subscription_details` model, `start_date` has been updated to `start_date_at` to follow our standard naming practices.

## 🎉 Feature Updates 🎉
- Introducing the new model `stripe__invoice_details`.
- Updated the models `stripe__daily_overview` with additional daily and rolling metrics. 
- `subscription_item_id` has been added to the `stripe__invoice_line_items` model.
- Added the ability to union datasets across different schemas or databases. A new column populating each model called `source_relation` will specify the source of each record. 

For more information please refer to the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/blob/main/README.md) and [stripe.yml](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/blob/main/models/stripe.yml)

# dbt_stripe v0.7.2

## 🎉 Feature Updates
- Databricks compatibility 🧱 ([#44](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/pull/44))


# dbt_stripe v0.7.1
## Feature Updates 🎉
- README updates for easier package navigation and understanding. ([#41](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/pull/41))
## Under the Hood
- Updating the package dependency to reference the proper [">=0.7.0", "<0.8.0"] version range of `dbt_stripe_source`. ([#41](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/pull/41))


# dbt_stripe v0.7.0
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- Stripe connectors set up after February 09, 2022 no longer sync the `subscription` table; however, a newer `subscription_history` table is synced. To account for this change a variable `stripe__subscription_history` has been added to the package project to allow for users to define if their source contains the `subscription_history` table. ([#37](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe_source/pull/37))
  - By default this variable is set to `false`. If you still have the `subscription` table, then there is no adjustment needed on your end. If you do have the `subscription_history` table then you will want to set the variable to `true`. 
  - Similarly, if you have both tables, then I highly encourage you start leveraging the `subscription_history` source table in your package.
  - This package now points to the latest `dbt_stripe_source` package version which accounts for the above update. ([#33](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/pull/33) and [#34](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/pull/34))

# dbt_stripe v0.6.1
## 🐞 Bug Fixes 🐞
- [#24](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/issues/24): Updating docs to add `dbt_stripe` documentation in addition to `dbt_stripe_source` documentation.
- [#27](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/issues/27): Updating `models/stripe__customer_overview.sql` to use `max` instead of `min` for calculating `most_recent_sale_date`. 
- [#28](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/issues/28): Updating `models/stripe__customer_overview.sql` to include "No Associated Customer" records. 
  - This PR accounts for when a transaction may be tied to a customer_id that has not yet synced into the customers table due primarily due to a sync lapse between the tables; in which case, the customer_description field will be "No Associated Customer". 
  - Each "No Associated Customers" record will be an individual row, since we can not predictably do any group bys due to the `stripe__customer_metadata` variable variability in both datatype and number of metadata fields.

# dbt_stripe v0.6.0
🎉 dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility 🎉
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_stripe_source`. Additionally, the latest `dbt_stripe_source` package has a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

# dbt_stripe v0.5.1

## Features
- Add functionality to include customer metadata in `stripe__customer_overview`. ([#21](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/pull/21)) The customer metadata is passed in from the `stg_stripe__customer` model in the Stripe source package.
    - For more information refer to the [Stripe source package CHANGELOG](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

# dbt_stripe v0.1.0 -> v0.5.0
