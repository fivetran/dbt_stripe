  - name: stripe__ending_balance_reconciliation_itemized_4
    description: Modeled after the [titular report](https://stripe.com/docs/reports/payout-reconciliation#schema-ending-balance-reconciliation-itemized-4) from Stripe, each record represents an automatic payout and additional details such as associated customer, shipping, card, subscription information. This report belongs to the class of Payout Reconciliation reports. The Payout reconciliation report helps you match the payouts you receive in your bank account with the batches of payments and other transactions that they relate to. The payout reconciliation report is only available for users with automatic payouts enabled, and is optimized for users who prefer to reconcile the transactions included in each payout as a settlement batch. If you use manual payouts or prefer to track and reconcile your Stripe balance like a bank account, see the Balance report instead. To help you decide which report is right for you, see the guide for selecting reports. This Ending Balance Reconciliation section provides a similar breakdown of the transactions that hadn’t been settled as of the report’s end date.
