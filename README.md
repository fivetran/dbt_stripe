# DBT Stripe 

This DBT project aims to calculate important financial metrics, such as the MRR, from Stripe data. For such, It utilizes a Stripe DBT package from Fivetran as described below

# Stripe Package

This package models Stripe data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/stripe). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/stripe#schemainformation).

This package enables you to better understand your Stripe transactions. Its main focus is to enhance the balance transaction entries with useful fields from related tables. Additionally, the metrics tables allow you to better understand your account activity over time or at a customer level. These time-based metrics are available on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly level.

## Models

This package contains transformation models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Stripe source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe_source). A dependency on the source package is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. The primary outputs of this package are described below. Intermediate models are used to create these output models.

| **model**                          | **description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Installation Instructions

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/stripe
    version: [">=0.7.0", "<0.8.0"]
```

## Configuration

Please, check [Fivetran project page](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe) for configuration instruction.

### Build Schema and source
By default this package will build the Stripe staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_stripe`) and the Stripe final models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stripe`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your modeled Stripe data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
  stripe:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
  stripe_source:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

This package only accepts one schema as a source, as in the use case of this project we have two different Stripe schemas, [another DBT project](https://github.com/Maxihost/dbt_stripe_account_src) is used as source joining the two stripe data sources.

*Read more about using custom schemas in dbt [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas).*

## Models Schema

This project has the following models schema:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2
name: 'stripe'
version: '0.1.0'

require-dbt-version: [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]
models:
  stripe:
    +schema: stripe
    +materialized: table
    intermediate:
      +materialized: ephemeral
    mart:
      +schema: data_marts
      +materialized: view
```

- **Intermediate:** Reusable CTE code for tables. To know more about ephemeral materialization check [DBT Docks](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/materializations)
- **Mart:** Data mart views created for specific dashboards or reports.
- **Models:** Tables created utilizing the Stripe package.
